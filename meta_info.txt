this will be a XML document, too.

Summary Text:
This is a documentation to build a DIY enclosure for the 3D printer model Rostock Max V2 that is part of the RepRap family of 3d printers and sold by SeeMeCNC and through various resellers. Enclosures are typically self-built, because a USA patent (attached) seems to be an obstacle for most providers to sell them as standard accessory. This project uses PLA and ABS prints with the printer itself, laser cut acrylic sheets and a few metric of-the-shelf components only. Enclosures are desirable to improve the quality of especially ABS prints by increasing the temperature of the print environment and by preventing quick temperature changes e.g. by drafts. ABS print especially benefit from both a lower temperature difference between the heated printer bed and the environment because the material shrinks more than PLA when cooling down, which leads to warping and splitting of prints. Many enclosures are heated to 50-70 degree Celsius, but this current version is unheated and only inherently heats up to 30-40 degr.C. Please share if you implement further improvements for this enclosure. My design files can be seen and modified online in the Onshape project: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d590c2db52ca428e97d68baa/w/b00a0e533d044792ac7fa99f/e/468f1fb1db04.
